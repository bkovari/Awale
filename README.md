# Awale
This repository includes a console application Awale game. 
The program was made for a home assignment 
for Software Design and Development subject in University of Obuda John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics. 
The game had to be implemented using plain data structures and low-level toolset. Feel free to try and share.
